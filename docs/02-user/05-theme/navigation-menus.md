# Navigation Menus

https://www.helloqt.de/wp-admin/site-editor.php?path=%2Fnavigation

Navigation is the Block equivalent of the classic Menus. And like the classic menus, they don’t come predefined with the theme. However, unlike classic menus, Navigation blocks are not tied to any screen locations. To display a given navigation menu, it will need to be added to the preferred location in a theme template or part.

The theme comes with placeholders for all locations where navigation menus should be located. After creation, the appropriate navigation should be assigned to its area/placeholder. Otherwise, a random one will be displayed in its place.

The navigation areas/placeholders are in the following template parts: -

Header: Main navigation for the entire site other than the home page.

Header - Home Page: Navigation for the home page. Only contains links to itself according to the design.

Navigation Drawer: For small screens.

Main navigation. Contains links to all or most parts of the site.

Bottom navigation. Optional. Can be used for non-core links such as privacy policy.

Footer:

Main navigation. Contains links to all or most parts of the site.

Contacts. Contact information composed of links. E.g. email address, phone number, whatsapp link.

Bottom navigation. For non-core links such as privacy policy.

To serve these areas, the following navigations were created and assigned during theme setup.

## Translation Management

All Navigation menus will always need to be translated.

This can be done from WPML’s Translation Manager.

https://www.helloqt.de/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tm%2Fmenu%2Fmain.php&sm=dashboard.

On the first dropdown, select Navigation Menus and Filter to view translatable menus. Then select them for translation. The URLs should point to the translated versions of their originals.
