# Case Studies

To distinguish them from other content types, case studies are managed using their own post type, case_study

Admin: https://www.helloqt.de/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=case-study

Front: https://www.helloqt.de/fallstudien

Case studies are just like regular posts with the exception that they can be assigned a custom taxonomy, technology. Technology is just like a regular tag/category with the exception that the technology’s featured image is displayed according to HelloQt’s design.

## Content Management.

Each case study’s content can be added and managed in a similar way to the home page. The case studies can also be assigned 1 or more technologies. Each of these technologies will need to have a featured image assigned.

## Translation Management

Translation of case studies is similar to that of regular posts and pages. On top of this, the technologies will also need to be translated.
